**Figure**: Schematics for the process of a bursting bubble: (a) A gas bubble in bulk. (b) The bubble approaches the free surface forming a liquid film (thickness $\delta$) between itself and the free surface. (c) A bubble cavity forms when the thin liquid film disappears.

<caption><p align="center">Experiment: Impact of a hexadecane oil drop on another drop (of the same liquid) sitting on a superamphiphobic substrate. Experiment was done by [Olinka Soto](https://pof.tnw.utwente.nl/people/profile/1052). Impact Weber number, $We = 1.44$, and the offset between the axes of the two drops is 0.48 times the equivalent radius of the drops.</caption>
