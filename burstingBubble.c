# Changelog Sep 29, 2024 v2.0
* Removed adapt_wavelet_limited.h and replaced it with adapt_wavelet (in built in Basilisk)
* Removed omega adaption based on vorticity as it does not work anymore ... 
* Adaptation based on curvature is only triggered after the kink in the initial condition disappears. -- #TODO: fix me... this was working fine until a few years ago. first step would be to find out when this issue started...

This repository contains the codes used for simulating the cases discussed in the manuscript: Bursting bubble in a viscoplastic medium. The results presented here are currently under review in Journal of Fluid Mechanics. The preprint of the article is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07744).

The supplementary videos are available [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf5C5HCrvhLFETl6iaRr21pzr5Xab1OCM)

# Introduction:
We investigate the classical problem of bubble bursting at a liquid-gas interface, but now in the presence of a viscoplastic liquid medium. Here are the schematics of the problem. This simualtion will start from Figure 1(c).

  /**
  We consider the burst of a small axisymmetric bubble at a surface of an incompressible Bingham fluid. To nondimensionalise the governing equations, we use the initial bubble radius $R_0$, and inertia-capillary velocity $V_\gamma = \sqrt{\gamma/(\rho_lR_0)}$, respectively. Pressure and stresses are scaled with the characteristic capillary pressure, $\gamma/R_0$. The dimensionless equations for mass and momentum conservation, for the liquid phase, then read

  $$
  \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} = 0
  $$
  $$
  \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + \nabla\boldsymbol{\cdot}\left(\boldsymbol{uu}\right) = -\nabla p + \nabla\boldsymbol{\cdot}\boldsymbol{\tau} - \mathcal{B}o\,\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Z}}},
  $$
  where $\boldsymbol{u}$ is the velocity vector, $t$ is time, $p$ is the pressure and $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ represents the deviatoric stress tensor. We use the regularized Bingham model with
  $$
  \boldsymbol{\tau} = 2\,\text{min}\left(\frac{\mathcal{J}}{2\|\boldsymbol{\mathcal{D}}\|} + \mathcal{O}h, \mathcal{O}h_\text{max}\right)\boldsymbol{\mathcal{D}}
  $$
  where $\|\boldsymbol{\mathcal{D}}\|$ is the second invariant of the deformation rate tensor, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{D}}$, and $\mathcal{O}h_{max}$ is the viscous regularisation parameter. The three dimensionless numbers controlling the equations above are the capillary-Bingham number $\left(\mathcal{J}\right)$, which accounts for the competition between the capillary and yield stresses, the Ohnesorge number $\left(\mathcal{O}h\right)$ that compares the inertial-capillary to inertial-viscous time scales, and the Bond number $\left(\mathcal{B}o\right)$, which compares gravity and surface tension forces:
  $$
  \mathcal{J} = \frac{\tau_yR_0}{\gamma},\,\,\mathcal{O}h = \frac{\mu_l}{\sqrt{\rho_l\gamma R_0}},\,\,\mathcal{B}o = \frac{\rho_l gR_o^2}{\gamma}.
  $$

  Here, $\gamma$ is the liquid-gas surface tension coefficient, and $\tau_y$ and $\rho_l$ are the liquid's yield stress and density, respectively. Next, $\mu_l$ is the constant viscosity in the Bingham model. Note that in our simulations, we also solve the fluid's motion in the gas phase, using a similar set of equations (Newtonian). Hence, the further relevant non-dimensional groups in addition to those above are the ratios of density $\left(\rho_r = \rho_g/\rho_l\right)$ and viscosity $\left(\mu_r = \mu_g/\mu_l\right)$. In the present study, these ratios are kept fixed at $10^{-3}$ and $2 \times 10^{-2}$, respectively (see above).

## Initial Condition

The initial shape of the bubble at the liquid-gas interface can be calculated by solving the Young-Laplace equations ([Lhuissier & Villermaux, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2011.418​)) and it depends on the $\mathcal{B}o$ number. 
Resources: 

* [Alex Berny's Sandbox](http://www.basilisk.fr/sandbox/aberny/bubble/bubble.c)
* [My Matlab code:](https://github.com/VatsalSy/Bursting-Bubble-In-a-Viscoplastic-Medium/blob/main/InitialCondition.m) Also see the results for different $\mathcal{B}o$ number [here](https://youtu.be/Z_vdsOW5fsg).

  <caption><p align="center">Comparision of the initial shape calculated using the Young-Laplace equations. Ofcourse, for this study, we only need: $\mathcal{B}o = 10^{-3}$. In the figure, $a$ is the capillary length, $a = \sqrt{\gamma/(\rho_lg)}$</caption>
</p>

Since we do not focus on the influence of $\mathcal{B}o$ number in the present study, I am not elaborating on it here. For all the simulations, I use the interfacial shape calculated for $\mathcal{B}o = 10^{-3}$. The resultant data file is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VatsalSy/Bursting-Bubble-In-a-Viscoplastic-Medium/main/Bo0.0010.dat).

**Note:** The curvature diverges at the cavity-free surface intersection. We fillet this corner to circumvent this singularity, introducing a rim with a finite curvature that connects the bubble to the free surface. We ensured that the curvature of the rim is high enough such that the subsequent dynamics are independent of its finite value.

Bursting bubble dynamics for different capillary-Bingham numbers. (a) $\mathcal{J} = 0.0$: A typical case with a Newtonian liquid medium, (b) $\mathcal{J} =0.1$: A weakly viscoplastic liquid medium in which the process still shows all the major characteristics of the Newtonian liquid, (c) $\mathcal{J} = 0.5$: A case of moderate yield stress whereby the jetting is suppressed, nonetheless the entire cavity still yields, and (d) $\mathcal{J} = 1.0$: A highly viscoplastic liquid medium whereby a part of the cavity never yields. The left part of each video shows the magnitude of the velocity field, and the right part shows the magnitude of the deformation tensor on a $\log_{10}$ scale. The transition to the black region (low strain rates) marks the yield-surface location in the present study. For all the cases in this figure, $\mathcal{O}h = 10^{-2}$.
